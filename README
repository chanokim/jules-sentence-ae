JULIE Sentence Boundary Detector (JSBD)

Introduction
============
JSBD is a ML-based sentence splitter. It can be retrained on supported
training material and is thus neither language nor domain dependent.



Dependencies
============ 
JSBD is based on a slightly modified version of the machine learning toolkit MALLET (Version 2.0.x). The
necessary libraries are included in the lib/ directory.


Usage
=====

To run JSBD just run the script "runJSBDpackaged.sh". This will show the available modes.

Documentation
==============
For further information please refer to the documentation, JSBD-x.pdf.
